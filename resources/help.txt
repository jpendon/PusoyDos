Introduction: Pusoy dos (Filipino Poker) is a variation of the card game Big Two. The goal of the game is to be the first to discard all of the player's cards. Cards can be played seperately or in certain combinations such as poker hands. Pusoy Dos is played with three or four players.

Rules: The dealer shuffles and deals the entire deck until each player has 13 cards. In games with three players, each player will have at least 17 cards with one player getting an extra card. The game begins when the player holding the three of clovers plays that card or a valid combination that includes the card. Then the next player goes and plays a higher combination of the same number of cards or passes their turn. Once a player passes, they cannot rejoin the round until a new round has started. If there is only one player remaining in the round, then that player starts a new round by playing any card or card combination. The first person to play all of their cards wins the game.
